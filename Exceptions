a) What is null pointer Exception?
	Null ponter Exception Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required.
    these includes :
	--Calling the instance method of a null object.
	--Accessing or modifying the field of a null object.
	--Taking the length of null as if it were an array.
	--Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array.
	--Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value.

b) When “Unable to add window to Activity…. Is your Activity running”
   error occurs?
	This exception occurs when the app is trying to notify the user from the background thread (AsyncTask) by opening a Dialog.

c) What is ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception?
	ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. 
	The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

d) “Activity not found? Have you declared this activity in your manifest
   file”?
	Every application must have an AndroidManifest.xml file (with precisely that name) in its root directory. 
	The manifest file provides essential information about your app to the Android system, 
	which the system must have before it can run any of the app's code.
	so if we dont mention our activity name in manifest file we will get this error.

e) No such method getColor() found?	
	The old method is deprecated starting in API 23, and the new method only exists in API 23+. 
	If we try to attempt to call the new method on a device running API <23 we will get this error.
	we can either perform an API level check and call the appropriate method, 
	or we can use ContextCompat.getColor(Context, int) from the support-v4 library.
